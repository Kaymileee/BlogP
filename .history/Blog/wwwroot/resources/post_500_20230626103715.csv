<pre><code>return x == 0 ? """" : ""Hello""

<p>does?</p>

<pre><code>let x = 1+1
let y = 1 + 1
</code></pre>

<p>are the same.</p>

<p>I think it has something to do with optionals. But when you use a <code>?</code> operator on a variable, it must be used like this:</p>

<pre><code>let s: String? = nil
let x = s?.startIndex
</code></pre>

<p>I mean it must follow another operator, right?</p>

<p>So a specific question: I have an array of strings and I can call reverse() on it.</p>

<pre><code>let arr = [""Mykonos"", ""Rhodes"", ""Naxos""].reverse()
</code></pre>

<p>Now naively I thought I'd get back a type of Array from this. (Ruby for example has a similar method that you pass an array and get back an array)</p>

<p>But arr is now actually of type</p>

<pre><code>ReverseRandomAccessCollection&lt;Array&lt;String&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which is actually a struct, which conforms to CollectionType:</p>

<pre><code>public struct ReverseRandomAccessCollection&lt;Base : CollectionType where Base.Index : RandomAccessIndexType&gt; : _ReverseCollectionType
</code></pre>

<p>This means I can do this:</p>

<pre><code>for item in arr {
  print(item)
}
</code></pre>

<p>but I can't do</p>

<pre><code>print(arr[0])
</code></pre>

<p>Why is this designed to be this way?</p>

<p>Dictionaries in Swift also implement CollectionType, so I can do this:</p>

<pre><code>let dict = [""greek"" : ""swift sometimes"", ""notgreek"" : ""ruby for this example""].reverse()
</code></pre>

<p>But dictionaries are not ordered like arrays, so why can I call reverse() on dicts?</p>

1607019,How to make Xcode automatically conform to a protocol,"<p>When I use a prototype table view, I always have to conform to the protocol <code>TableViewDataSource</code>. I always forget what methods I need to implement, so I have to look at the source of the protocol every time. This is really time consuming.</p>

<p>I think Xcode must have a feature that automatically implements the needed methods for you, right? Just like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and Visual Studio.</p>

<p>I want to know where can I find this feature. If there's isn't, is there a workaround for this? At least I don't have to open the source code of the protocol each time I conform to it.</p>

<p>If you don't understand what I mean, here's some code:</p>

<p>I have a protocol</p>

<pre><code>protocol Hello {
    func doStuff ()
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I conform to it,</p>

<pre><code>class MyClass: Hello {

}
</code></pre>

<p>I often don't remember the names of the methods that I need to implement. If Xcode has a feature that turns the above code, into this:</p>

<pre><code>class MyClass: Hello {
    func doStuff () {
        code
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now you understand what I mean? I just want to ask where to find such a feature.</p>

1607020,java mongodb driver how do you catch exceptions?,"<p>I want to be able to detect if a mongo server is available from the java driver for the purpose of reacting to any abnormal events as one would in JDBC land etc. It all works fine when the server is up but I am struggling to understand why it is so difficult to detect errors. I have a feeling its because the mongo client runs in a different thread and it doesn't re throw to me or something?</p>

<pre><code>try {
        MongoClient mongoClient = new MongoClient(""localhost"", 27017);
        MongoDatabase db = mongoClient.getDatabase(""mydb"");
        // if db is down or error getting people collection handle it in catch block
        MongoCollection&lt;Document&gt; people = commentarr.getCollection(""people"");
    } catch (Exception e) {
        // handle server down or failed query here.
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The result is </p>

<pre><code>INFO: Exception in monitor thread while connecting to server localhost:27017
</code></pre>

<p>With the resulting stack trace containing a few different exceptions which I have tried to catch but my catch blocks still didn't do anything.</p>

<pre><code>com.mongodb.MongoSocketOpenException: Exception opening socket
Caused by: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused
</code></pre>

<p>I am using the java mongodb driver 3.0.4, most posts I read are from an older API with hacks like <code>MongoClient.getDatabaseNames()</code> which throws a <code>MongoException</code> if errors, except this is deprecated now and replaced with <code>MongoClient.listDatabaseNames()</code> which doesn't have the same error throwing semantics.</p>

<p>Is there a way to just execute a mongo query from the java driver in a try catch block and actually have the exception caught?</p>

1607043,Passing a component as an 'argument' to another component in Angular 2,"<p>I am new to web development and I have just started building an Angular 2 app. At this point I am trying to create some CRUD components/forms but I find my self duplicating a lot of code. I am not going to ask what are the common best practices to avoid code duplication and achieve component reusability when designing CRUD applications with Angular2, because the post will get locked. I will rather focus on one particular aspect:</p>

<p>I have a ""CRUD page"" that has a list (it is an html table actually) of resources and several buttons that open up ""create"", ""read"", and ""edit"" forms. The list is a separate component on its own and the create/read/edit separate components as well. Each row of the table includes another component which knows how to render a resource item. I will call this <code>&lt;resource-item&gt;</code> component. However, I have several of those ""CRUD pages"", each page for a different resource. So what I want is to reuse the list component for all the resources. So the first thing to do is to add Inputs or Attributes to the list component in order to control its labels. So far so good. </p>

<p>But what about the <code>&lt;resource-item&gt;</code> component? Each resource of my application might have a completely different structure. As a result I will need different components for different resources, e.g.: <code>&lt;resource-a-item&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;resource-b-item&gt;</code>, etc. How can I specify which resource item component I want to use every time I create a list component?</p>

1607047,Creating a stopwatch with redux,"<p>I've been trying to make a stopwatch in react and redux. I've been having trouble trouble figuring out how to design such a thing in redux. </p>

<p>The first thing that came to mind was having a <code>START_TIMER</code> action which would set the initial <code>offset</code> value. Right after that, I use <code>setInterval</code> to fire off a <code>TICK</code> action over and over again that calculates how much time has passed by using the offset, adds it to the current time, and then updates the <code>offset</code>.</p>

<p>This approach seems to work, but I'm not sure how I would clear the interval to stop it. Also, it seems like this design is poor and there is probably a better way to do it.</p>

const timer = (state = initialState, action) =&gt; {

I come from a Java background and my approach to debugging projects is usually a combination of stack traces, compile errors, and - on larger projects - lots of test cases. However, much of this doesn't seem to directly translate to the world of web-dev; particularly debugging my code that's interacting with Angular2's libraries.</p>

<p>Could anyone suggest any approaches that I can take to debug code working with Angular2? Specifically; how can I see what parts of my HTML/TS is causing issues? I've checked the console, from which I can see that I've broken Angular2, but it doesn't seem much more informative from that.</p>

df['Date'] = df['Date'].astype('datetime64')

<p>Say I want to match row 1 in the above df.<br>
I know beforehand that I want to match ID <code>1</code>.<br>
And I know the date I want as well, and as a matter of fact, I'll extract that date directly from row 1 of the df to make it bulletproof.</p>

some_date = df.iloc[1:2]['Date']  # gives 2016-01-01

1607088,Should Comparable ever compare to another type?,"<p>I'm wondering if there's ever a valid use case for the following:</p>

<pre><code>class Base {}

class A implements Comparable&lt;Base&gt; {
    //...
}
</code></pre>

<p>It seems to be a common pattern (see <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Collections</a> for a number of examples) to accept a collection of type <code>T</code>, where <code>T extends Comparable&lt;? super T&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>But it seems technically impossible to fulfill the contract of <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Comparable.html#compareTo-T-"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>compareTo()</code></a> when comparing to a base class, because there's no way to ensure that another class doesn't extend the base with a contradictory comparison. Consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code>class Base {
    final int foo;
    Base(int foo) {
        this.foo = foo;
    }
}

class A extends Base implements Comparable&lt;Base&gt; {
    A(int foo) {
        super(foo);
    }
    public int compareTo(Base that) {
        return Integer.compare(this.foo, that.foo); // sort by foo ascending
    }
}

class B extends Base implements Comparable&lt;Base&gt; {
    B(int foo) {
        super(foo);
    }
    public int compareTo(Base that) {
        return -Integer.compare(this.foo, that.foo); // sort by foo descending
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>We have two classes extending <code>Base</code> using comparisons that don't follow a common rule (if there were a common rule, it would almost certainly be implemented in <code>Base</code>). Yet the following broken sort will compile:</p>

<pre><code>Collections.sort(Arrays.asList(new A(0), new B(1)));
</code></pre>

<p>Wouldn't it be safer to only accept <code>T extends Comparable&lt;T&gt;</code>? Or is there some use case that would validate the wildcard?</p>

<pre><code>foo :: (a -&gt; Maybe a) -&gt; a -&gt; a
foo f x = fromMaybe x (f x)

<p>Since it seems like a general-purpose function, I wondered if it wasn't already defined, so <a href=""https://twitter.com/ploeh/status/684418608454352896"">I asked on Twitter</a>, and <a href=""https://twitter.com/bitemyapp/status/684467784793886720"">Chris Allen replied</a> that it's <code>ap fromMaybe</code>.</p>

<p>That sounded promising, so I fired up GHCI and started experimenting:</p>

<pre><code>Prelude Control.Monad Data.Maybe&gt; :type ap
ap :: Monad m =&gt; m (a -&gt; b) -&gt; m a -&gt; m b
Prelude Control.Monad Data.Maybe&gt; :type fromMaybe
fromMaybe :: a -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; a
Prelude Control.Monad Data.Maybe&gt; :type ap fromMaybe
ap fromMaybe :: (b -&gt; Maybe b) -&gt; b -&gt; b

<p>The type of <code>ap fromMaybe</code> certainly looks correct, and a couple of experiments seem to indicate that it has the desired behaviour as well.</p>

<p>But <strong>how does it work?</strong></p>

<p>The <code>fromMaybe</code> function seems clear to me, and in isolation, I think I understand what <code>ap</code> does - at least in the context of <code>Maybe</code>. When <code>m</code> is <code>Maybe</code>, it has the type <code>Maybe (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; Maybe b</code>.</p>

<p>What I don't understand is how <code>ap fromMaybe</code> even compiles. To me, this expression looks like partial application, but I may be getting that wrong. If this is the case, however, I don't understand how the types match up.</p>

<p>The first argument to <code>ap</code> is <code>m (a -&gt; b)</code>, but <code>fromMaybe</code> has the type <code>a -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; a</code>. How does that match? Which <code>Monad</code> instance does the compiler infer that <code>m</code> is? How does <code>fromMaybe</code>, which takes two (curried) arguments, turn into a function that takes a single argument?</p>

1607116,Can I export a Sqlite db using RedBean PHP ORM and Import to MySQL?,"<p>I have a simple web app that I've been building using <code>redbean</code> PHP which has a really simple structure with three bean types:</p>

<p>areas
buildings
persons</p>

<p>All relationships are exclusive 1:Many. So, a <code>Person</code> belongs to only 1 <code>Building</code>, and a <code>Building</code> belongs to 1 <code>Area</code>. </p>

<pre><code>Area
  BuildingList
    PersonList
</code></pre>

<p>Currently, I have been developing it using <code>Sqlite3</code> for ease of development, but I want to move the data to <code>mySQL</code>. I have a lot of data that I've already added.</p>

<p>Is there an easy way to use RedBean to Export ALL beans to the new MySql Database?</p>

<p>I know I can search for a <code>sqlite</code> -> <code>MySQL</code>/<code>MariaDB</code> converter, but I also potentially want to be able to use this in reverse to make migrating the site super easy to move/backup/change DBs.</p>

<p>What I've tried below:</p>

<pre><code>R::setup('sqlite:/' . __DIR__ . '/data/database.db'); 
R::addDatabase('mysql', $MySqlConn );

$old_datas = R::findAll( 'area' );
R::selectDatabase( 'mysql' );

foreach ($old_datas as $bean) {
    $new_area = R::dispense('area');
    $new_area-&gt;importFrom( $bean );
    $id = R::store( $new_area );
    var_dump( $new_area ); // shows new data
}

var_dump( R::findAll( 'area' ) ); // returns empty array

1607117,Simulate display: inline in React Native,"<p>React Native doesn't support the CSS <code>display</code> property, and by default all elements use the behavior of <code>display: flex</code> (no <code>inline-flex</code> either). Most non-flex layouts can be simulated with flex properties, but I'm flustered with inline text.</p>

<p>My app has a container that contains several words in text, some of which need formatting. This means I need to use spans to accomplish the formatting. In order to achieve wrapping of the spans, I can set the container to use <code>flex-wrap: wrap</code>, but this will only allow wrapping at the end of a span rather than the traditional inline behavior of wrapping at word breaks.</p>

<p>Defer pushes a function call to a stack. When the function containing the defer statement returns, the defered function calls are popped and executed one by one, in the scope that the defer statement was inside in the first place. Defer statements look like function calls, but are not executed until they are popped.</p>

<p>Go example of how it works:</p>

<pre><code>func main() {
    fmt.Println(""counting"")

    var a *int
    for i := 0; i &lt; 10; i++ {
        a = &amp;i
        defer fmt.Println(*a, i)
    }

    x := 42
    a = &amp;x

    fmt.Println(""done"")

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>var app = angular.module('myApp');

app.controller('ModalController', ['$uibModalInstance', modalControllerFn]);

function modalControllerFn($uibModalInstance) {

    scope.close = function() {
        $uibModalInstance.close(scope.data);
    }
}
</code></pre>



<h3>Question (1)</h3>

<p>Does passing anything belonging to the modal scope using <code>$uibModalInstance.close</code> (non-literal value, i.e: <code>scope.x</code>) prevents angular garbage collection from destroying the entire modal scope? is this a scenario for causing memory leaks?</p>

<p><strong>my-element.html</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;dom-module id=""my-element""&gt;    
  &lt;template&gt;
    &lt;div id=""container"" style=""height:100px; background-color:green; color:white;""&gt;

  &lt;script&gt;
    Polymer({
      is: 'my-element',

      _onTestClick: function() {
        // expand the height of container
      }
    });    
  &lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/dom-module&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I then used the grow height animation shown <a href=""https://github.com/PolymerElements/paper-menu-button/blob/master/paper-menu-button-animations.html"">here</a> for inspiration. So, I basically, have a animation defined like this:</p>

<pre><code>Polymer({
  is: 'grow-height-animation',
  behaviors: [
    Polymer.NeonAnimationBehavior

  configure: function(config) {
    var node = config.node;

    }, {
      height: height + 'px'
    }], this.timingFromConfig(config));
    return this._effect;
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>My challenge is, I do not understand how to integrate this animation with the <code>div</code> element with the id of ""container"". Everything I see seems like it only works on Polymer elements.

1607188,Should subscribeOn and observeOn only be invoked by the final subscriber?,"<p>The <a href=""http://www.introtorx.com/content/v1.0.10621.0/15_SchedulingAndThreading.html"">Scheduling and Threading</a> section of <em>Intro to Rx</em> says that </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the use of SubscribeOn and ObserveOn should only be invoked by the final subscriber</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It also says that in an UI application, the presentation layer, which is normally the final subscriber, should be the one to invoke these methods.</p>

<p>I am wondering if the advice is solid, since I see some situations in which this is not convenient:</p>

<ol>
<li>For starters, I don't believe that the presentation layer should decide where an Observable coming from the data layer should be subscribed. In my opinion, the presentation layer should be unaware if the data is coming from a database, from a REST API, or from memory. For this reason, it's convenient for the data layer to call <code>subscribeOn()</code> before returning the Observable, passing the IO Scheduler or the immediate Scheduler as convenient.</li>
<li>If the presentation layer gets the Observable from some service or use case (which in turn gets it from the data layer) and this service decides that it needs to process the stream in some computation Scheduler, why should the presentation layer care about this?</li>
<li>What about a stream that is originally coming from the UI, so it needs to be subscribed in the UI thread. Then it will be sent to some service to do some work and finally come back to the presentation layer to be observed in the UI thread. That would require the UI stream to be <code>subscribeOn()</code> the UI Scheduler, then <code>observeOn()</code> some other Scheduler, and finally <code>observeOn()</code> the UI Scheduler. In this case, being able to invoke <code>subscribeOn()</code> and <code>observeOn()</code> only in the final subscriber would mean that the stream can only be processed in the UI thread.</li>
</ol>

<p>Is there some good reason why I should sacrifice the architecture of my application and ignore Rx's ability to easily switch threads by invoking these two methods only by the final subscriber?</p>

    return {

        authToken
    }

export const LOGIN_FAILURE = 'LOGIN_FAILURE'

            .catch(error =&gt; dispatch(loginFailure(error)))
    }

</code></pre>

<p>Again, in redux DevTools I can see that this works as expected. When <code>dispatch(login(formData))</code> is called in <code>onSubmit</code> in the LoginForm, first the <code>LOGIN_REQUEST</code> action is dispatched, followed by <code>LOGIN_SUCCESS</code> or <code>LOGIN_FAILURE</code>. <code>LOGIN_REQUEST</code> will add a property <code>state.auth.pending = true</code> to the store, <code>LOGIN_SUCCESS</code> and <code>LOGIN_FAILURE</code> will remove this property. (I know this might me something to use <a href=""https://github.com/rackt/reselect"" rel=""noreferrer"">reselect</a> for, but for now I want to keep it simple.</p>

<p>Now, in the redux-form docs I read that I can return a promise from <code>onSubmit</code> to update the form state (<code>submitting</code>, <code>error</code>). But I'm not sure what's the correct way to do this. <code>dispatch(login(formData))</code> returns <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p>I could exchange the <code>state.auth.pending</code> flag in the store with a variable like <code>state.auth.status</code> with the values <em>requested</em>, <em>success</em> and <em>failure</em> (and again, I could probably use reselect or something alike for this).</p>

<p>I could then subscribe to the store in <code>onSubmit</code> and handle changes to <code>state.auth.status</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>// ...

class LoginForm extends Component {
    constructor (props) {
        super(props)
        this.onSubmit = this.onSubmit.bind(this)
    }
    onSubmit (formData, dispatch) {
        const { store } = this.context
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
            const unsubscribe = store.subscribe(() =&gt; {
                const state = store.getState()
                const status = state.auth.status

                if (status === 'success' || status === 'failure') {
                    unsubscribe()
                    status === 'success' ? resolve() : reject(state.auth.error)
                }
            })
            dispatch(login(formData))
        }).bind(this)
    }

    // ...
}
// ...
LoginForm.contextTypes = {
    store: PropTypes.object.isRequired
}

// ...
</code></pre>

<p>However, this solution doesn't feel good and I'm not sure if it will always work as expected when the app grows and more actions might be dispatched from other sources.</p>

<p>Another solution I have seen is moving the api call (which returns a promise) to <code>onSubmit</code>, but I would like to keep it seperated from the React component.</p>

<p>Any advice on this?</p>

1607207,"PowerShell guidelines for -Confirm, -Force, and -WhatIf","<p>Are there any official guidelines from Microsoft about when to add <code>-Confirm</code>, <code>-Force</code>, and <code>-WhatIf</code> parameters to custom PowerShell cmdlets? There doesn't seem to be a clear consensus about when/how to use these parameters. For example <a href=""https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell/issues/475"" rel=""noreferrer"">this issue</a>.</p>

<p>In the absence of formal guidelines, is there a best practice or rule of thumb to use? Here is some more background, with my current (possibly flawed) understanding:</p>

<h2>-WhatIf</h2>

<p>The <code>-WhatIf</code> flag displays what the cmdlet <em>would do</em> without actually performing any action. This is useful for a dry run of a potentially destabilizing operation, to see what the actual results would be. The parameter is automatically added if the cmdlet's <code>Cmdlet</code> attribute has the <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.management.automation.cmdletcommonmetadataattribute.supportsshouldprocess(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>SupportsShouldProcess</code></a> property set to true.</p>

<p>It seems like (but I'd love to see more official guidance here) that you should add <code>-WhatIf</code> if you are ever adding or removing resources. (e.g. deleing files.) Operations that update existing resources probably wouldn't benefit from it. Right?</p>

<h2>-Force</h2>

<p>The <code>-Force</code> switch is used to declare ""I know what I'm doing, and I'm sure I want to do this"". For example, when copying a file (<a href=""https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849793.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Copy-File</code></a>) the <code>-Force</code> parameter means:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Allows the cmdlet to copy items that cannot otherwise be changed, such as copying over a read-only file or alias.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So to me it seems like (again, I'd love some official guidance here) that you should add an optional <code>-Force</code> parameter when you have a situation where the cmdlet would otherwise fail, but can be convinced to complete the action.</p>

<p>For example, if you are creating a new resource that will clobber an existing one with the same name. The default behavior of the cmdlet would report an error and fail. But if you add <code>-Force</code> it will continue (and overwrite the existing resource). Right?</p>

<h2>-Confirm</h2>

<p>The <code>-Confirm</code> flag gets automatically added like <code>-WhatIf</code> if the cmdlet has <code>SupportsShouldProcess</code> set to true. In a cmdlet if you call <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.management.automation.cmdlet.shouldprocess(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ShouldProcess</code></a> then the user will be prompted to perform the action. And if the <code>-Confirm</code> flag is added, there will be no prompt. (i.e. the confirmation is added via the cmdlet invocation.)</p>

<p>So <code>-Confirm</code> should be available whenever a cmdlet has a big impact on the system. Just like <code>-WhatIf</code> this should be added whenever a resource is added or removed.</p>

<p>With my potentially incorrect understanding in mind, here are some of the questions I'd like a concrete answer to:</p>

<ul>
<li>When should it be necessary to add <code>-WhatIf</code>/<code>-Confirm</code>?</li>
<li>When should it be necessary to add <code>-Force</code>?</li>
<li>Does it ever make sense to support both <code>-Confirm</code> and <code>-Force</code>?</li>

<p>I want to get my Flask app + gunicorn both outputting JSON formatted logging. I've got this working for the Flask app, but I can't seem to get it working with gunicorn.</p>

<p>Here's my current output:</p>

So what we have now is only <code>AFHTTPSessionManager</code>and <code>NSURLSession</code> that does not subclass <code>NSOperation</code>. I have class <code>APIClient</code> that subclasses <code>AFHTTPSessionManager</code>. I am using that class as singleton as <code>sharedClient</code>.

               parameters:(NSDictionary *)parameters

} failure:^(NSURLSessionDataTask *task, NSError *error) {
    failure(task, [Response createErrorWithAFNetworkingError:error]);
}];

return task;

The main Application file is marked as <code>@EnableAutoConfiguration</code>. The datasource is lookedup from JNDI is configured using java config and the class which create the datasource is marked as <code>@Configuration</code>.</p>

<p>I have a test class as below.</p>

<pre><code>@RunWith( SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class )
@WebAppConfiguration
@ContextConfiguration( classes = Application.class )
public class TestSomeBusiness {}
</code></pre>

<p>The issue is when I run the test case, the datasource jndi lookup happens, which fails because the test case is not running inside a server environment. As far as I know the classes in classpath marked with <code>@Configuration</code> are executed and that the reason the datasource lookup is being called.</p>

<p>The work around for now I have found is instead of JNDI lookup create the datasource using <code>DriverManagerDataSource</code>, so that even if its not a server environment the datasource lookup won't fail.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<p>1) How do we generally deal with datasource (when looking up from JNDI) in 
spring boot application for testing ?</p>

<p>2) Is there a way to exclude the datasource configuration class from being called when executing test case ?</p>

<p>3) Should I create an embedded server so that the JNDI lookup can be done when executing test case ?</p>

1607231,How do you implement strtol under const-correctness?,"<p>According to <a href=""http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/strtol/"">http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/strtol/</a> this function has a signature of <code>long int strtol (const char* str, char** endptr, int base)</code>.</p>

<p>I wonder, though: If it gets passed a <code>const char *</code> to the beginning of the string, how does it manage to turn that into a non-const pointer to the first unprocessed character without cheating? What would an implementation of strtol look like that doesn't perform a const_cast?</p>

1607232,Throwing an array local to a try block,"<p>From C++ Primer 18.1.1:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the [thrown] expression has an array or function type, the expression is
  converted to its corresponding pointer type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How is it that this program can produce correct output of <code>9876543210</code> (g++ 5.2.0)?</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;

int main(){

    try{
        int a[10] = {9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0};
        throw a;
    }
    catch(int* b) { for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i) cout &lt;&lt; *(b+i); }

}
</code></pre>

<p>From the quote, <code>throw a</code> would create an exception object of type <code>int*</code> which is a pointer to the first element of the array. But surely the array elements of <code>a</code> would be destroyed when we exit the <code>try</code> block and enter the catch clause since we change block scope? Am I getting a false positive or are the array elements ""left alone"" (not deleted) during the duration of the catch clause?</p>

I have a very simple UAP app in HTML/JavaScript that has a reference to a Windows Runtime Component which has a reference to a Class Library.</p>

1607234,Build versus Runtime Dependencies in Nix,"<p>I am just starting to get to grips with Nix, so apologies if I missed the answer to my question in the docs.</p>

<p>I want to use Nix to setup a secure production machine with the minimal set of libraries and executables. I don't want any compilers or other build tools present because these can be security risks. </p>

<p>When I install some packages, it seems that they depend on only the minimum set of runtime dependencies. For example if I install <code>apache-tomcat-8.0.23</code> then I get a Java runtime (JRE) and the pre-built JAR files comprising Tomcat.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some packages seem to include a full build toolchain as dependencies. Taking another Java-based example, when I install <code>spark-1.4.0</code> Nix pulls down the Java development kit (JDK) which includes a compiler, and it also pulls the Maven build tool etc.</p>

<p>So, my questions are as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Do Nix packages make any distinction between build and runtime dependencies?</li>
<li>Why do some packages appear to depend on build tools whereas others only need runtime? Is this all down to how the package author wrapped up the application?</li>
<li>If a package contains build dependencies that I don't want, is there anything that I, as the operator, can do about it except design my own alternative packaging for the same application?</li>
</ol>

<p>Many thanks.</p>

On mobile","<p>In Redux, every change to the store triggers a <code>notify</code> on all connected components. This makes things very simple for the developer, but what if you have an application with N connected components, and N is very large?</p>

<p>Every change to the store, even if unrelated to the component, still runs a <code>shouldComponentUpdate</code> with a simple <code>===</code> test on the <code>reselect</code>ed paths of the store. That's fast, right? Sure, maybe once. But N times, for <em>every</em> change? This fundamental change in design makes me question the true scalability of Redux.</p>

<p>As a further optimization, one can batch all <code>notify</code> calls using <code>_.debounce</code>. Even so, having N <code>===</code> tests for every store change <em>and</em> handling other logic, for example view logic, seems like a means to an end.</p>

<p>I'm working on a health &amp; fitness social mobile-web hybrid application with millions of users and am transitioning from <strong>Backbone to Redux</strong>. In this application, a user is presented with a swipeable interface that allows them to navigate between different stacks of views, similar to Snapchat, except each stack has infinite depth. In the most popular type of view, an endless scroller efficiently handles the loading, rendering, attaching, and detaching of feed items, like a post. For an engaged user, it is not uncommon to scroll through hundreds or thousands of posts, then enter a user's feed, then another user's feed, etc. Even with heavy optimization, the number of connected components can get very large.</p>

<p>Now on the other hand, Backbone's design allows every view to listen precisely to the models that affect it, reducing N to a constant.</p>

<p>Now I can run my custom lint rules by runnig command:</p>

<p>And I will get output message like I expected in console.</p>

<p>But I want to debug my XXXDetector source file. How can I do that?
If I click ""debug"" or ""run"" or ""build"" , my custom lint rules will NOT run! So I have to run it in console, which don't support debug.
How can I solve this?</p>

1607255,PyODBC : can't open the driver even if it exists,"<p>I'm new to the linux world and I want to query a Microsoft SQL Server from Python. I used it on Windows and it was perfectly fine but in Linux it's quite painful.</p>

<p>The disassembly of this particular function continues on, but one thing I noticed is the relatively large number of <code>call</code> instructions like this one:</p>

<pre><code>20:   e8 00 00 00 00          callq  25 &lt;bar&lt;foo, 0u&gt;::get(bool)+0x25&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>These instructions, always with the opcode <code>e8 00 00 00 00</code>, occur frequently throughout the generated code, and from what I can tell, are nothing more than no-ops; they all seem to just fall through to the next instruction. This begs the question, then, is there a good reason why all these instructions are generated? </p>

<p>I'm concerned about the instruction cache footprint of the generated code, so wasting 5 bytes many times throughout a function seems counterproductive. It seems a bit heavyweight for a <code>nop</code>, unless the compiler is trying to preserve some kind of memory alignment or something. I wouldn't be surprised if this were the case.</p>

<p>I compiled my code using g++ 4.8.5 using <code>-O3 -fomit-frame-pointer</code>. For what it's worth, I saw similar code generation using clang 3.7.</p>

        return new GuardArgument&lt;T&gt;(value, argumentName);

    public string Name { get; private set; }
}

// Example extension for validity checks
public static GuardArgument&lt;T&gt; IsNotNull&lt;T&gt;(this GuardArgument&lt;T&gt; guardArgument, string errorMessage)
{
    if (guardArgument.Value == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentNullException(guardArgument.Name, errorMessage);
    }

    return guardArgument;
}     
</code></pre>

<p>At the moment the code can be used in a similar way to (note this is just a dumb example):</p>

<pre><code>void DummyMethod(int? someObject) {

    Guard.Ensure(someObject, ""someObject"")
       .IsNotNull()
       .IsGreaterThan(0)
       .IsLessThan(10);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This all works fine.  What I want to be able to do now is extend the API to include child properties in the checks in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>Guard.Ensure(someObject, ""someObject"")
    .IsNotNull()
    .Property(
        (x =&gt; x.ChildProp1, ""childProp1"")
           .IsNotNull()
           .IsGreaterThan(10)
     )
     .Property(
        (x =&gt; x.ChildProp2, ""childProp2"")
           .IsNotNull()
           .IsLessThan(10)
     );
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously the new <code>.Property</code> method needs to return the parent <code>GuardArgument</code> in order to chain. Furthermore the child property needs to be able to use the existing check methods (<code>IsNotNull()</code> etc) to avoid code duplication.</p>

<p>I cannot work out how to construct the lambda/Property function parameters or where the <code>.Property</code> method should be located - i.e. should it be a property on the <code>GuardArgument</code> or somewhere else, or even if there is a better structure to the API.</p>

<p><strong>When you are mocking all of your calls, what is the best way to detect if the actual model of the objects returned by your server has been modified ?</strong></p>

<p>Your tests would still pass because they're testing an outdated version of the model but the app is potentially broken.</p>

<p>For example, if a mock assumes that <code>/api/users/1</code> returns <code>null</code> if the user doesn't exist, when it actually returns an empty object, then although the tests may pass, the behaviour being tested relies on incorrect assumptions and may therefore fail in unexpected ways.</p>

<p>Or maybe the backend is somehow providing static json files with the latest up-to-date model and the frontend relies on this ?</p>

However, what I've noticed is that these changes are not cached in Docker when using a docker executor. I had naively assumed that after running these commands, docker would cache the image, so for the next run or test, docker would just load the cached image produced after <code>before_script</code>. This would drastically speed up builds.</p>

<p>As an example, my <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> looks a little like:</p>

<pre><code>image: ubuntu

before_script:
    - apt-get update -qq &amp;&amp; apt-get install -yqq make ...

build:
    script:
        - cd project &amp;&amp; make

<p>A possible solution is to go to the runner machine and create a docker image that can build my software without any other installation and then reference it in the <code>image</code> section of the yaml file. The downside of this is that whenever I want to add a dependency, I need to log in to the runner machine and update the image before builds will succeed. It would be much nicer if I just had to add the dependency to to the end of <code>apt-get install</code> and have docker / gitlab-ci handle the appropriate caching.</p>

<p>There is also a <code>cache</code> command in <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code>, which I tried setting to <code>untracked: true</code>, which I thought would cache everything that wasn't a byproduct of my project, but it didn't seem to have any effect.</p>

Should I request the session server side rather than read it from cookies?</li>

However, if I replace the SVG images with PNG images, the scrolling is perfectly smooth and responsive.</p>

<p>Here's a demonstration of the difference: <a href=""https://jsfiddle.net/NathanFriend/42knwc1s/"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://jsfiddle.net/NathanFriend/42knwc1s/</a></p>

<p>Why is the SVG scrolling performance so much worse than the PNG scrolling performance?  After the browser renders an SVG image, I would assume it doesn't need to rerender the image until the image is manipulated in some way (like resizing).  Does scrolling an element that contains SVG images cause the images to be rerendered for every frame of the scroll animation?</p>

1607314,Opening non-default browser with lite-server in angular2 quick start guide,"<p>Having followed the TypeScript version of the <a href=""https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html"">Angular 2 Quick Start guide</a>, I was wondering if it is possible, and if so how to configure the lite-server to launch a browser other than the default.</p>

<p>It seems lite-server will take command line args, served to it via <code>yargs.argv</code>.  And it seems <code>yargs</code> will attempt to parse command line args based on fairly common standards (i.e. If a token begins with a <code>--</code>, it represents an argument name, otherwise an argument value) to obtain <code>argv</code>.  lite-server will attempt to use the <code>open</code> property that it gets from <code>argv</code>, which is ultimately what launches the browser via [one of the of the node packages that launches processes]. node-open? xdg -open? Not sure, not really as important to me right now as long as my assumption (based on looking at several of these process launchers) is correct, that they all optionally take an argument defining the process to launch.  If omitted, the default browser would be used since the file type to open is html, which is what happens.</p>

<p>If all that is correct, or at least the gist  of it, then it seems I just need to specify <code>--open chrome</code>, for example (assuming chrome is in my <code>PATH</code> - working on a win machine btw), at the end of the <code>lite</code> command defined in <code>package.json</code>.</p>

<p>So something like...</p>

<pre><code>""scripts"": {
    ""tsc"": ""tsc"",
    ""tsc:w"": ""tsc -w"",
    ""lite"": ""lite-server"",
    ""lite:c"": ""lite-server --open chrome"",
    ""lite:f"": ""lite-server --open firefox "",
    ""start"": ""concurrent \""npm run tsc:w\"" \""npm run lite\"" ""
},
</code></pre>

<p>I apologize if this seems inane, but I won't be at a computer where I can test this for a few days, and I need to know if I have the answer and can stop researching this :). Thanks!</p>

1607326,Make the `drop` argument in `dcast` only look at the RHS of the formula,"<p>The <code>drop</code> argument in <code>dcast</code> (from ""reshape2"" or ""dplyr"") can be useful when going from a ""long"" to a ""wide"" dataset and you want to create columns even for combinations that do not exist in the long form.</p>

<p>It turns out that using <code>drop</code> also affects combinations the left hand side (LHS) of the formula as well as the right hand side (RHS). Thus, it also creates extra <em>rows</em> based on the combinations of LHS values.</p>

<p>Is there a way to override this behavior?</p>

<hr>

<p>Here's some sample data:</p>

<pre><code>library(data.table)
DT &lt;- data.table(v1 = c(1.105, 1.105, 1.105, 2.012, 2.012, 2.012),
                 ID = c(1L, 1L, 1L, 2L, 2L, 2L), 
                 v2 = structure(c(2L, 3L, 5L, 1L, 2L, 6L), 
                                .Label = c(""1"", ""2"", ""3"", ""4"", ""5"", ""6""), 
                                class = ""factor""),
                 v3 = c(3L, 2L, 2L, 5L, 4L, 3L)) 
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that ""v2"" is a <code>factor</code> column with 6 levels. I essentially want to go from ""long"" to wide"", but add in columns for any missing factor levels (in this case ""4"").</p>

<p><code>reshape</code> handles the shape, but not the missing columns:</p>

<pre><code>reshape(DT, direction = ""wide"", idvar = c(""ID"", ""v1""), timevar = ""v2"")
#       v1 ID v3.2 v3.3 v3.5 v3.1 v3.6
# 1: 1.105  1    3    2    2   NA   NA
# 2: 2.012  2    4   NA   NA    5    3
</code></pre>

<p><code>dcast</code> handles adding the missing columns, but only if there's one value on the LHS:</p>

<pre><code>dcast(DT, ID ~ v2, value.var = ""v3"", drop = FALSE)
#    ID  1 2  3  4  5  6
# 1:  1 NA 3  2 NA  2 NA
# 2:  2  5 4 NA NA NA  3
</code></pre>

<p>If there are multiple values on the LHS, the combinations of the values on the LHS are also expanded out, as if we had used <code>CJ</code> or <code>expand.grid</code>, but rows 2 and 3 are not at all of interest to me:</p>

<pre><code>dcast(DT, ... ~ v2, value.var = ""v3"", drop = FALSE)
#       v1 ID  1  2  3  4  5  6
# 1: 1.105  1 NA  3  2 NA  2 NA
# 2: 1.105  2 NA NA NA NA NA NA
# 3: 2.012  1 NA NA NA NA NA NA
# 4: 2.012  2  5  4 NA NA NA  3
</code></pre>

<p>This is similar to using <code>xtabs</code> in base R: <code>ftable(xtabs(v3 ~ ID + v1 + v2, DT))</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Is there a way to let <code>dcast</code> know that essentially, ""Hey. The combination of values on the LHS are the IDs. Don't try to fill them in for me.""</p>

<p>My current approach is to do three steps, one for collapsing down the LHS values, another for spreading out the RHS values, and then one for merging the result.</p>

<pre><code>merge(DT[, list(v1 = unique(v1)), .(ID)],  ## or unique(DT[, c(""ID"", ""v1""), with = FALSE])
      dcast(DT, ID ~ v2, value.var = ""v3"", drop = FALSE), 
      by = ""ID"")[]
#    ID    v1  1 2  3  4  5  6
# 1:  1 1.105 NA 3  2 NA  2 NA

<p>Now on this page, I'd like to display an object from STORE with this ID.</p>

        author: 'admin',
        id: 1
      }
    ]
</code></pre>

<p>My question is:
should the function to query the the object from the STORE be in the page file, before the render method, or should I use action creators and include the function in reducers.
I've noticed that the reduceres seem to contain only actions that have an impoact on store, but mine just queries the store.</p>

I need SpringDataRest (SDR) to store complete full <em>A</em> object with its <em>B</em> objects (children) using single one POST request. I tried several combinations in SDR, the only one which worked for me, was to create @RepositoryRestResource for object <em>A</em> and to create @RepositoryRestResource also for object <em>B</em>, but mark this (<em>B</em>) as exported=false (if I did not create repository out of object <em>B</em> at all, it would not work -> just <em>A</em> object would be stored on single POST request, but not its children (@OneToMany relation) of type <em>B</em>; the same outcome occurs if exported=false is omitted for <em>B</em> repository).
 Is this ok and the only way how to achieve it (single POST request with storing all objects at once)?</p>

<p>The reason I'm asking, in my previous example, I have to (I would like to) control all objects ""lifecycle"" by using <em>A</em>'s repository. I am ok with it, because <em>A</em>-><em>B</em> relation is composition (<em>B</em> does not exists outside of <em>A</em>). But I have serious problem of editing (also removing) one certain object of type <em>B</em> by SDR using its parent repository (since object <em>B</em> doest not have its own repository exported). Maybe, this is not possible by definition. I have tried these solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>PATCH for ""/A/1/B/2"" does not work -> method not allowed (in headers
is ""Allow: GET, DELETE"") -> so, also PUT is out of question</li>
<li>Json Patch would not work either - PATCH for ""/A/1"" using json patch
content-type [{""op"": ""add"", ""path"": ""/B/2"", ....}] -> ""no such index
in target array"" - because Json Patch uses scalar ""2"" after ""array""
as a index to its array. This is not practical in Java world, when
relations are kept in Set of objects - indexing has no meaning
at all.</li>
<li>I could export repository (exported=true) of object <em>B</em> for
manipulating it ""directly"", but this way I would loose ability to
store the whole object <em>A</em> with its <em>B</em> objects at one single POST
request as I have mentioned before.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would like to avoid sending the whole <em>A</em> object with one single tiny   modification of its <em>B</em> object for PUT, if possible.
Thank you.</p>

1607380,"iOS Universal Device App with SpriteKit, how to scale nodes for all views?","<p>I want to make a <strong><em>landscape</em> app</strong> to be <strong>universal</strong>, so that the sprite nodes scale proportionally to whatever view size is running the app.  I'd like an <em>entirely programmatic</em> solution because I don't like the IB. </p>

<p>My game is pretty simple, and I don't need scrolling or zooming of any kind, so the whole game will always be present and take up the entire view.</p>

<p>Is it possible that what I'm looking for is to change the size of the scene to always fit the view? If so, can you explain this thoroughly because I've tried changing this section of my view controller</p>

<pre><code>    if let scene = GameScene(fileNamed:""GameScene"")
</code></pre>

<p>to be the constructor method that takes size as a parameter but Xcode doesn't like that.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Things I've tried</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Using fractions of self.view.bounds.width/height. This usually makes all iPhones look good, but on iPads stretches and skews nodes and the boundary box around thew view.</li>
<li>Changing the scaleMode among all four types. I'd like to keep good practice and feel like .AspectFill (default) is the one I should make my app work with, but open to suggestions. Note; I don't want black edges on any device, just the entire view displayed/scaled proportionally.</li>
<li>Applying programmatic constraints. Now I'm fairly new to this and don't understand constraints completely, but no tutorials I've seen even from RayWenderlich talk about constraints on nodes so I didn't delve to deep in this.</li>
<li><p>Using a method like this to convert points among views. This actually worked pretty well for point positioning of nodes, and if possible I would like this method to work out, but then I still have the problem of sizes of nodes. Also when I build for iPad with this method the view seems to start off as portrait and the nodes look fine but then I have to manually switch it to landscape and the sprites and view boundaries once again get messed up.  Here's the method:</p>

<pre><code>func convert(point: CGPoint)-&gt;CGPoint {
    return self.view!.convertPoint(CGPoint(x: point.x, y:self.view!.frame.height-point.y), toScene:self)
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Countless vid tutorials on RW and everywhere else on internet.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks in advance! I appreciate the help.  I know this topic is weird because a lot of people ask questions about it but everyone's situation seems to be different enough that one solution doesn't fit all.</p>

1607383,How to refresh the page after a ServiceWorker update?,"<p>I've consulted a lot of resources on Service Workers:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://jakearchibald.com/2014/using-serviceworker-today/#updating-your-serviceworker"" rel=""noreferrer"">Updating your ServiceWorker</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://ponyfoo.com/articles/serviceworker-revolution"" rel=""noreferrer"">ServiceWorker: Revolution of the Web Platform</a></li>
<li>Jake Archibald's lovely <a href=""https://github.com/jakearchibald/svgomg/blob/6c21157b65dd779bbf2dd2adf9831aaf71d4bb08/src/js/sw/index.js"" rel=""noreferrer"">SVGOMG</a>. </li>
</ul>

<p>However, I can't for the life of me figure out how to update the page after a new ServiceWorker has been installed. No matter what I do, my page is stuck on an old version, and only a hard refresh (Cmd-Shift-R) will fix it. No combination of 1) closing the tab, 2) closing Chrome, or 3) <code>location.reload(true)</code> will serve the new content.</p>

<p>I have a <a href=""https://github.com/nolanlawson/serviceworker-update-demo"" rel=""noreferrer"">super simple example app</a> mostly based on SVGOMG. On installation, I cache a bunch of resources using <code>cache.addAll()</code>, and I also do <code>skipWaiting()</code> if the current version's major version number doesn't match the active version's number (based on an IndexedDB lookup):</p>



<pre><code>self.addEventListener('install', function install(event) {
  event.waitUntil((async () =&gt; {
    var activeVersionPromise = localForage.getItem('active-version');
    var cache = await caches.open('cache-' + version);
    await cache.addAll(staticContent);
    var activeVersion = await activeVersionPromise;
    if (!activeVersion ||
      semver.parse(activeVersion).major === semver.parse(version).major) {
      if (self.skipWaiting) { // wrapping in an if while Chrome 40 is still around
        self.skipWaiting();
      }
    }
  })());
});
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using a semver-inspired system where the major version number indicates that the new ServiceWorker can't be hot-swapped for the old one. This works on the ServiceWorker side - a bump from v1.0.0 to v1.0.1 causes the worker to be immediately installed on a refresh, whereas from v1.0.0 to v2.0.0, it waits for the tab to be closed and reopened before being installed.</p>

<p>Back in the main thread, I'm manually updating the ServiceWorker after registration &ndash; otherwise the page never even gets the memo that there's a new version of the ServiceWorker available (oddly I found very few mentions of this anywhere in the ServiceWorker literature):</p>



<pre><code>navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw-bundle.js', {
  scope: './'
}).then(registration =&gt; {
  if (typeof registration.update == 'function') {
    registration.update();
  }
});
</code></pre>

<p>However, the content that gets served to the main thread is always stuck on an old version of the page (""My version is 1.0.0""), regardless of whether I increment the version to 1.0.1 or 2.0.0.</p>

<p>I'm kind of stumped here. I was hoping to find an elegant semver-y solution to ServiceWorker versioning (hence my use of <code>require('./package.json').version</code>), but in my current implementation, the user is perpetually stuck on an old version of the page, unless they hard-refresh or manually clear out all their data. :/</p>

<p>I want to create a product that I want to sell in a SaaS business model, I already have the backend more or less thought out and some code in place in nodejs. It handles oAuth, sessions, and controls the roles of the users when accessing a certain endpoint.</p>

<p>The doubt is in the frontend architecture:
Each client will share the same functionality, but the design of their page will be completely different from one another. 
I want to put as much of the app logic that I can in services, so I can reuse it, my idea is to only change controllers/templates/directives from client to client, is this ok?</p>

<p>Should I have different folders and serve the static files for each client from nodejs?
ex:
in nodejs I would know the url for client1 was called so I would serve client1-index.html?</p>

<p>should I put each client in their own nodejs server and their own host?</p>

<p>what other ways are there?</p>

<p>I would like to be able to easily reuse the services as Iâ€™ll be introducing changes to the features or adding more, and I want to do this upgrades easily.</p>

<p>There will also be an admin panel that will be exactly the same for all of them, the part that will change is the one my client's users see.</p>

<p>Think of it as having many clients and giving each of them a store, so they can sell their stuff. They want an admin page and a public page. The admin page will the same for all, but the public page has to change.</p>

<p>The error message I am getting basically tells mit that <code>bower-angular-translate</code> does not have a version tag that satisfies <code>2.8.1</code>, but the GitHub repository <a href=""https://github.com/angular-translate/bower-angular-translate/releases/tag/2.8.1""><em>does</em> have a version 2.8.1</a>.<br>
The failing packages are <code>angular-ui-router</code>, <code>angular-local-storage</code> and <code>angular-translate</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Why I want to display horizontally rather than vertically?</strong></p>

<p>It will save the paper. For example, if the user generate 4 Identity cards only then as per current scenario, it will generate 4 cards in column 1 and the whole page space is wasted because I can not re-use the left space. </p>

<p>By repeating the column direction to horizontally, the 4 cards will be displayed as in column 1, card 1 and 3 and in column 2, card 2 and 4 will  be displayed. I can then cut the paper and reuse it later.</p>

1607398,Reliability issues with Checkpointing/WAL in Spark Streaming 1.6.0,"<h1>Description</h1>

<p>We have a Spark Streaming 1.5.2 application in Scala that reads JSON events from a Kinesis Stream, does some transformations/aggregations and writes the results to different S3 prefixes. The current batch interval is 60 seconds. We have 3000-7000 events/sec. Weâ€™re using checkpointing to protect us from losing aggregations.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s been working well for a while, recovering from exceptions and even cluster restarts. We recently recompiled the code for Spark Streaming 1.6.0, only changing the library dependencies in the <em>build.sbt</em> file. After running the code in a Spark 1.6.0 cluster for several hours, weâ€™ve noticed the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>â€œInput Rateâ€ and â€œProcessing Timeâ€ volatility has increased substantially (see the screenshots below) in 1.6.0.</li>
<li>Every few hours, thereâ€™s an â€˜â€™Exception thrown while writing record: BlockAdditionEvent â€¦  to the WriteAheadLog. java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException: Futures timed out after [5000 milliseconds]â€ exception (see complete stack trace below) coinciding with the drop to 0 events/sec for specific batches (minutes).</li>
</ol>

<p>After doing some digging, I think the second issue looks related to this <a href=""https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/9143"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pull Request</a>. The initial goal of the PR: â€œWhen using S3 as a directory for WALs, the writes take too long. The driver gets very easily bottlenecked when multiple receivers send AddBlock events to the ReceiverTracker. This PR adds batching of events in the ReceivedBlockTracker so that receivers donâ€™t get blocked by the driver for too long.â€</p>

<p>We are checkpointing in S3 in Spark 1.5.2 and there are no performance/reliability issues. Weâ€™ve tested checkpointing in Spark 1.6.0 in S3 and local NAS and in both cases weâ€™re receiving this exception. It looks like when it takes more than 5 seconds to checkpoint a batch, this exception arises and weâ€™ve checked that the events for that batch are lost forever.</p>

<h1>Questions</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Is the increase in â€œInput Rateâ€ and â€œProcessing Timeâ€ volatility expected in Spark Streaming 1.6.0 and is there any known way of improving it?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you know of any workaround apart from these 2?:</p>

<p>1) To guarantee that it takes less than 5 seconds for the checkpointing sink to write all files. In my experience, you cannot guarantee that with S3, even for small batches. For local NAS, it depends on whoâ€™s in charge of infrastructure (difficult with cloud providers).</p>

<p>2) Increase the spark.streaming.driver.writeAheadLog.batchingTimeout property value.</p></li>
<li><p>Would you expect to lose any events in the described scenario? I'd think that if batch checkpointing fails, the shard/receiver Sequence Numbers wouldn't be increased and it would be retried at a later time.</p></li>
</ul>

1607399,Compound literal lifetime and if blocks,"<p>This is a theoretical question, I know how to do this unambiguously, but I got curious and dug into the standard and I need a second pair of standards lawyer eyes.</p>

<p>Let's start with two structs and one init function:</p>

<pre><code>struct foo {
    int a;
};
struct bar {
    struct foo *f;
};
struct bar *
init_bar(struct foo *f)
{
    struct bar *b = malloc(sizeof *b);
    if (!b)
        return NULL;
    b-&gt;f = f;
    return b;
}
</code></pre>

<p>We now have a sloppy programmer who doesn't check return values:</p>

<pre><code>void
x(void)
{
    struct bar *b;

    b = init_bar(&amp;((struct foo){ .a = 42 }));
    b-&gt;f-&gt;a++;
    free(b);
}
</code></pre>

<p>From my reading of the standard there's nothing wrong here other than potentially dereferencing a NULL pointer. Modifying <code>struct foo</code> through the pointer in <code>struct bar</code> should be legal because the lifetime of the compound literal sent into <code>init_bar</code> is the block where it's contained, which is the whole function <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>But now we have a more careful programmer:</p>

<pre><code>void
y(void)
{
    struct bar *b;

    if ((b = init_bar(&amp;((struct foo){ .a = 42 }))) == NULL)
        err(1, ""couldn't allocate b"");

</code></pre>

<p>Code does the same thing, right? So it should work too. But more careful reading of the C11 standard is leading me to believe that this leads to undefined behavior. (emphasis in quotes mine)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>6.5.2.5 Compound literals</p>
  
  <p>5 The value of the compound literal is that of an unnamed object initialized by the
  initializer list. If the compound literal occurs outside the body of a function, the object
  has static storage duration; otherwise, <em>it has automatic storage duration associated with
  the enclosing block</em>.</p>
  
  <p>6.8.4 Selection statements</p>
  
  <p>3 <em>A selection statement is a block</em> whose scope is a strict subset of the scope of its
  enclosing block. Each associated substatement is also a block whose scope is a strict
  subset of the scope of the selection statement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Am I reading this right? Does the fact that the <code>if</code> is a block mean that the lifetime of the compound literal is just the if statement?</p>

<p>(In case anyone wonders about where this contrived example came from, in real code <code>init_bar</code> is actually <code>pthread_create</code> and the thread is joined before the function returns, but I didn't want to muddy the waters by involving threads).</p>

1607407,SQLAlchemy eager loading multiple relationships,"<p>SQLAlchemy supports eager load for relationship, it is basically a <code>JOIN</code> statement. However, if a model has two or more relationships, it could be a very huge join. For example,</p>

<pre><code>class Product(Base):

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)
    name = Column(String(255), nullable=False)

    date = Column(TIMESTAMP, default=datetime.now())

class Tag(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'tag'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, autoincrement=True)

    tag_value = Column(String(255), nullable=False)

q = session.query(Product).join(User.addresses)\
    .options(joinedload(Product.orders))\
    .options(joinedload(Product.tags)).all()
</code></pre>

<p>The performance of this query is really bad, because the <code>JOIN</code> of <code>Order</code> and <code>Tag</code> will generate a huge table. But the <code>Order</code> and <code>Tag</code> has no relationship in here, so they should not be <code>JOIN</code>. It should be two separated queries. And because the session has some level of caching, so I changed my query to this.</p>

<pre><code>session.query(Product).join(Product.order) \
    .options(joinedload(Product.tags)).all()

q = session.query(Product).join(User.addresses) \
    .options(joinedload(Product.cases)).all()
</code></pre>

<p>This time the performance is way much better. However, I am not convinced that this is the correct to do it. I am not sure if the caches of tags will be expired when the session ends.</p>

1607415,A solution to SQLAlchemy temporary table pain?,"<p>It seems like the biggest drawback with SQLAlchemy is that it takes several steps backwards when it comes to working with temporary tables. A very common use case, for example, is to create a temporary table that is very specific to one task, throw some data in it, then join against it.</p>

<p>For starters, declaring a temporary table is verbose, and limited. Note that in this example I had to edit it because my classes actually inherit a base class, so what I give here may be slightly incorrect.</p>

<pre><code>@as_declarative(metaclass=MetaBase)
class MyTempTable(object):

    __tablename__ = ""temp""
    __table_args__ = {'prefixes': ['TEMPORARY']}

    id = Column(Integer(), primary_key=True)
    person_id = Column(BigInteger())
    a_string = Column(String(100))
</code></pre>

<p>Creating it is unintuitive:</p>

<pre><code>MyTempTable.__table__.create(session.bind)
</code></pre>

<p>I also have to remember to explictly drop it unless I do something creative to get it to render with ON COMMIT DROP:</p>

<pre><code>MyTempTable.__table__.drop(session.bind)
</code></pre>

<p>Also, what I just gave doesn't even work unless the temporary table is done ""top level"". I still haven't fully figured this out (for lack of wanting to spend time investigating why it doesn't work), but basically I tried creating a temp table in this manner inside of a nested transaction using session.begin_nested() and you end up with an error saying the relation does not exist. However, I have several cases where I create a temporary table inside of a nested transaction for unit testing purposes and they work just fine. Checking the echo output, it appears the difference is that one renders before the BEGIN statement, while the other renders after it. This is using Postgresql.</p>

<p>What does work inside of a nested transaction, and quite frankly saves you a bunch of time, is to just type out the damned sql and execute it using session.execute. </p>

<pre><code>        session.execute(text(
            ""CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp (""
            ""  id SERIAL,""
            ""  person_id BIGINT,""
            ""  a_string TEXT""
            "") ON COMMIT DROP;""
        ))
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, if you do this, you still need a corresponding table model to make use of ORM functionality, or have to stick to using raw sql queries, which defeats the purpose of SQLAlchemy in the first place.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if maybe I'm missing something here or if someone has come up with a solution that is a bit more elegant.</p>

1607420,Node Modular Architecture,"<p>I am building a nodejs application that is fairly large now. In an attempt to avoid a monolithic node application I have gone down the architectural route of a more modular system breaking out several components into separate npm modules. These are published using npm and installed in the dependent modules. I have about 6 different modules (which I would want to break out in to more) and now it has become difficult to manage the packages.</p>

<p><strong>The problems</strong> are:</p>

<ol>
<li>There is nested dependency so if I change module A and module B depends on module A and module C depends on module B, then when I update module A I need to publish a new version of it, which then means I need to update it in module B, which means I also need to publish of that and then finally I need to install that new version in module A ... you can see where that might be a pain. What's more the updating of the versions in all the package.json is manual and so error prone, and waiting for each publish is time consuming.</li>
<li>Modules can share npm dependencies and so sometimes conflicts occur when packages get updated. The more modules the higher the chance of conflict.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The benefits</strong> are that we have a very modular system where libraries can be reused easily and there is a clear hierarchy of modules enforced as there can't be any circular dependencies.</p>

<p><strong>Possible solutions</strong> are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Monolith</strong> - To manage the dependencies as a single app in a single repository with each module just becoming a services. This means that only one update is necessary and all the module apis will be in sync. However, referencing the libraries in the code might be a bit of a pain (as I believe they will have to be referenced relative to the local file), I am not sure how a structural hierarchy between the modules can be enforced and code reuse will be harder with modules outside the repository.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Microservices</strong> - To make each module a micro service. This maintains all the benefits of the modular system, but I am concerned that it will add a lot of complexity to the build and managing all the services will become a full time job in itself.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keep going</strong> - Work out a way to keep the current architecture but remove the trouble of pushing updates etc. Maybe scripts to update versions and shrinkwrap to ensure correct dependencies. I think this would both be difficult and would potentially lead it to being a monolithic system of a different variety.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Option 1 seems the most manageable to me but I don't want to lose the modular structure if I don't have to.</p>

<p>This is quite a broad question, but any suggestions/advice/comments would be really helpful.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

1607422,Why does Go panic on writing to a closed channel?,"<p>Why does Go panic on writing to a closed channel?</p>

<p>While one can use the <code>value, ok := &lt;-channel</code> idiom for reading from channels, and thus the ok result can be tested for hitting a closed channel:</p>

<pre><code>// reading from closed channel

package main

import ""fmt""

func main() {
    ch := make(chan int, 1)
    ch &lt;- 2
    close(ch)

    read(ch)
    read(ch)
    read(ch)
}

func read(ch &lt;-chan int) {
    i,ok := &lt;- ch   
    if !ok {
        fmt.Printf(""channel is closed\n"")
        return
    }
    fmt.Printf(""read %d from channel\n"", i)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>read 2 from channel
channel is closed
channel is closed
</code></pre>

<p>Run ""reading from closed channel"" on <a href=""http://play.golang.org/p/oJoLGeRI4S"" rel=""noreferrer"">Playground</a></p>

<p>Writing to a possibly closed channel is more convoluted, because Go will panic if you simply try to write when the channel is closed:</p>

<pre><code>//writing to closed channel

package main

import (
    ""fmt""
)

func main() {
    output := make(chan int, 1) // create channel
    write(output, 2)
    close(output) // close channel
    write(output, 3)
    write(output, 4)
}

// how to write on possibly closed channel
func write(out chan int, i int) (err error) {

    defer func() {
        // recover from panic caused by writing to a closed channel
        if r := recover(); r != nil {
            err = fmt.Errorf(""%v"", r)
            fmt.Printf(""write: error writing %d on channel: %v\n"", i, err)
            return
        }

        fmt.Printf(""write: wrote %d on channel\n"", i)
    }()

    out &lt;- i // write on possibly closed channel

    return err
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>write: wrote 2 on channel
write: error writing 3 on channel: send on closed channel
write: error writing 4 on channel: send on closed channel
</code></pre>

<p>Run ""writing to closed channel"" on <a href=""http://play.golang.org/p/qL7z3SVeqX"" rel=""noreferrer"">Playground</a></p>

<p>As far as I know, there is not a simpler idiom for writing into a possibly closed channel without panicking. Why not? What is the reasoning behind such an asymmetric behavior between read and write?</p>

<pre><code>foreach (var type in types)
{
    var fromTypes = getFromTypes(type); // { IInterface }
    var name = getName(type);           // null
    var lifetimeManager = getLifetimeManager(type); // null or ContainerControlled
    var injectionMembers = getInjectionMembers(type).ToArray(); // null

    RegisterTypeMappings(container, overwriteExistingMappings, type, name, fromTypes, mappings);

    if (lifetimeManager != null || injectionMembers.Length &gt; 0)
    {
        container.RegisterType(type, name, lifetimeManager, injectionMembers);   // !
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Because <code>fromTypes</code> is not empty, the <code>RegisterTypeMappings</code> adds one type mapping: <code>IInterface</code> -> <code>Implementation</code> (correct).</p>

<p>Then, in case when <code>lifetimeManager</code> is not null, the code attempts to change the lifetime manager with the following call:</p>

<pre><code>container.RegisterType(type, name, lifetimeManager, injectionMembers);
</code></pre>

<p>This function's name is completely misleading, because <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee650597.aspx"">the documentation</a> clearly states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>RegisterType a LifetimeManager for the given type and name with the container. No type mapping is performed for this type.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, not only the name is misleading but the documentation is wrong. When debugging this code, I've noticed, that when there is no mapping from <code>type</code> (<code>Implementation</code> in the scenarios presented above), it is added (as <code>type</code> -> <code>type</code>) and that's why we end up with three registrations in the first scenario.</p>

<p>I've downloaded Unity's sources to fix the problem, but I've found the following unit test:</p>

<pre><code>[TestMethod]
public void RegistersMappingAndImplementationTypeWithLifetimeAndMixedInjectionMembers()
{
    var container = new UnityContainer();
    container.RegisterTypes(new[] { typeof(MockLogger) }, getName: t =&gt; ""name"", getFromTypes: t =&gt; t.GetTypeInfo().ImplementedInterfaces, getLifetimeManager: t =&gt; new ContainerControlledLifetimeManager());

    var registrations = container.Registrations.Where(r =&gt; r.MappedToType == typeof(MockLogger)).ToArray();

    Assert.AreEqual(2, registrations.Length);

    // ...
</code></pre>

<p>- which is almost exactly my case, and leads to my question:</p>

<p>Why is this expected? Is it a conceptual mistake, a unit test created to match existing behaviour but not necessarily correct, or am I missing something important?</p>

<p>I'm using Unity v4.0.30319.</p>

1607442,Handling refresh tokens using rxjs,"<p>Since i've started with angular2 i have setup my services to return Observable of T. In the service i would have the map() call, and components using these services would just use subscribe() to wait for the response. For these simple scenarios i didnt really need to dig in to rxjs so all was ok. </p>

<p>I now want to achieve the following: i am using Oauth2 authentication with refresh tokens. I want to build an api service that all other services will use, and that will transparently handle the refresh token when a 401 error is returned. So, in the case of a 401, i first fetch a new token from the OAuth2 endpoint, and then retry my request with the new token. Below is the code that works fine, with promises:</p>

<pre><code>request(url: string, request: RequestOptionsArgs): Promise&lt;Response&gt; {
    var me = this;

    request.headers = request.headers || new Headers();
    var isSecureCall: boolean =  true; //url.toLowerCase().startsWith('https://');
    if (isSecureCall === true) {
        me.authService.setAuthorizationHeader(request.headers);
    }
    request.headers.append('Content-Type', 'application/json');
    request.headers.append('Accept', 'application/json');

    return this.http.request(url, request).toPromise()
        .catch(initialError =&gt; {
            if (initialError &amp;&amp; initialError.status === 401 &amp;&amp; isSecureCall === true) {
                // token might be expired, try to refresh token. 
                return me.authService.refreshAuthentication().then((authenticationResult:AuthenticationResult) =&gt; {
                    if (authenticationResult.IsAuthenticated == true) {
                        // retry with new token
                        me.authService.setAuthorizationHeader(request.headers);
                        return this.http.request(url, request).toPromise();
                    }
                    return &lt;any&gt;Promise.reject(initialError);
                });
            }
            else {
                return &lt;any&gt;Promise.reject(initialError);
            }
        });
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the code above, authService.refreshAuthentication() will fetch the new token and store it in localStorage. authService.setAuthorizationHeader will set the 'Authorization' header to previously updated token. If you look at the catch method, you'll see that it returns a promise (for the refresh token) that in its turns will eventually return another promise (for the actual 2nd try of the request).</p>

<p>I have attempted to do this without resorting to promises:</p>

<pre><code>request(url: string, request: RequestOptionsArgs): Observable&lt;Response&gt; {
    var me = this;

    request.headers = request.headers || new Headers();
    var isSecureCall: boolean =  true; //url.toLowerCase().startsWith('https://');
    if (isSecureCall === true) {
        me.authService.setAuthorizationHeader(request.headers);
    }
    request.headers.append('Content-Type', 'application/json');
    request.headers.append('Accept', 'application/json');

    return this.http.request(url, request)
        .catch(initialError =&gt; {
            if (initialError &amp;&amp; initialError.status === 401 &amp;&amp; isSecureCall === true) {
                // token might be expired, try to refresh token
                return me.authService.refreshAuthenticationObservable().map((authenticationResult:AuthenticationResult) =&gt; {
                    if (authenticationResult.IsAuthenticated == true) {
                        // retry with new token
                        me.authService.setAuthorizationHeader(request.headers);
                        return this.http.request(url, request);
                    }
                    return Observable.throw(initialError);
                });
            }
            else {
                return Observable.throw(initialError);
            }
        });
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code above does not do what i expect: in the case of a 200 response, it properly returns the response. However, if it catches the 401, it will successfully retrieve the new token, but the subscribe wil eventually retrieve an observable instead of the response. Im guessing this is the unexecuted Observable that should do the retry.</p>

<p>I realize that translating the promise way of working onto the rxjs library is probably not the best way to go, but i havent been able to grasp the ""everything is a stream"" thing. I have tried a few other solutions involving flatmap, retryWhen etc ... but didnt get far, so some help is appreciated.</p>

1607456,UWP ObservableCollection sorting and grouping,"<p>In UWP apps, how can you group and sort an ObservableCollection and keep all the live notification goodness?  </p>

<p>In most simple UWP examples I've seen, there is generally a ViewModel that exposes an ObservableCollection which is then bound to a ListView in the View. 
When items are added or removed from the ObservableCollection, the ListView automatically reflects the changes by reacting to the INotifyCollectionChanged notifications. This all works fine in the case of an unsorted or ungrouped ObservableCollection, but if the collection needs to be sorted or grouped, there seems to be no readily apparent way to preserve the update notifications. What's more, changing the sort or group order on the fly seems to throw up significant implementation issues.</p>

<p>++  </p>

<p>Take a scenario where you have an existing datacache backend that exposes an ObservableCollection of very simple class Contact.</p>

<pre><code>public class Contact
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public string State { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This ObservableCollection changes over time, and we want to present a realtime grouped and sorted list in the view that updates
in response to changes in the datacache. We also want to give the user the option to switch the grouping between LastName and State on the fly.</p>

<p>++</p>

<p>In a WPF world, this is relatively trivial. 
We can create a simple ViewModel referencing the datacache that presents the cache's Contacts collection as-is.</p>

<pre><code>public class WpfViewModel 
{
    public WpfViewModel()
    {
        _cache = GetCache();
    }

    Cache _cache;

    public ObservableCollection&lt;Contact&gt; Contacts
    {
        get { return _cache.Contacts; }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then we can bind this to a view where we implement a CollectionViewSource and Sort and Group definitions as XAML resources.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Window .....
   xmlns:scm=""clr-namespace:System.ComponentModel;assembly=WindowsBase""&gt;

   &lt;Window.DataContext&gt;
      &lt;local:WpfViewModel /&gt;
   &lt;/Window.DataContext&gt;

    &lt;Window.Resources&gt;
        &lt;CollectionViewSource x:Key=""cvs"" Source=""{Binding Contacts}"" /&gt;
        &lt;PropertyGroupDescription x:Key=""stategroup"" PropertyName=""State"" /&gt;
        &lt;PropertyGroupDescription x:Key=""initialgroup"" PropertyName=""LastName[0]"" /&gt;
        &lt;scm:SortDescription x:Key=""statesort"" PropertyName=""State"" Direction=""Ascending"" /&gt;
        &lt;scm:SortDescription x:Key=""lastsort"" PropertyName=""LastName"" Direction=""Ascending"" /&gt;
        &lt;scm:SortDescription x:Key=""firstsort"" PropertyName=""FirstName"" Direction=""Ascending"" /&gt;
    &lt;/Window.Resources&gt;

    &lt;Grid&gt;
        &lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;

                            &lt;ColumnDefinition Width=""100"" /&gt;
                            &lt;ColumnDefinition Width=""100"" /&gt;
                            &lt;ColumnDefinition Width=""*"" /&gt;
                        &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
                        &lt;TextBlock Text=""{Binding LastName}"" /&gt;
                        &lt;TextBlock Text=""{Binding FirstName}"" Grid.Column=""1"" /&gt;
                        &lt;TextBlock Text=""{Binding State}"" Grid.Column=""2"" /&gt;
                    &lt;/Grid&gt;
                &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
            &lt;/ListView.ItemTemplate&gt;
            &lt;ListView.GroupStyle&gt;
                &lt;GroupStyle&gt;
                    &lt;GroupStyle.HeaderTemplate&gt;

                            &lt;/Grid&gt;
                        &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
                    &lt;/GroupStyle.HeaderTemplate&gt;
                &lt;/GroupStyle&gt;
            &lt;/ListView.GroupStyle&gt;
        &lt;/ListView&gt;

        &lt;StackPanel Orientation=""Horizontal"" Grid.Row=""1""&gt;
            &lt;Button Content=""Group By Initial"" Click=""InitialGroupClick"" /&gt;
            &lt;Button Content=""Group By State"" Click=""StateGroupClick"" /&gt;
        &lt;/StackPanel&gt;

    &lt;/Grid&gt;
&lt;/Window&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then when the user clicks on the GroupBy buttons at the bottom of the window we can we can group and sort on the fly in code-behind.</p>

<pre><code>private void InitialGroupClick(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
     var cvs = FindResource(""cvs"") as CollectionViewSource;
     var initialGroup = (PropertyGroupDescription)FindResource(""initialgroup"");
     var firstSort = (SortDescription)FindResource(""firstsort"");
     var lastSort = (SortDescription)FindResource(""lastsort"");

     using (cvs.DeferRefresh())
     {
         cvs.GroupDescriptions.Clear();
         cvs.SortDescriptions.Clear();
         cvs.GroupDescriptions.Add(initialGroup);
         cvs.SortDescriptions.Add(lastSort);
         cvs.SortDescriptions.Add(firstSort);
     }
}

private void StateGroupClick(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
     var cvs = FindResource(""cvs"") as CollectionViewSource;
     var stateGroup = (PropertyGroupDescription)FindResource(""stategroup"");
     var stateSort = (SortDescription)FindResource(""statesort"");
     var lastSort = (SortDescription)FindResource(""lastsort"");
     var firstSort = (SortDescription)FindResource(""firstsort"");

     using (cvs.DeferRefresh())
     {
         cvs.GroupDescriptions.Clear();
         cvs.SortDescriptions.Clear();
         cvs.GroupDescriptions.Add(stateGroup);
         cvs.SortDescriptions.Add(stateSort);
         cvs.SortDescriptions.Add(lastSort);
         cvs.SortDescriptions.Add(firstSort);
     }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This all works fine, and the items are updated automatically as the data cache collection changes. The Listview grouping and selection remains unaffected by collection changes, and the new contact items are correctly grouped.The grouping can be swapped between State and LastName initial by user at runtime.</p>

<p>++</p>

<p>In the UWP world, the CollectionViewSource no longer has the GroupDescriptions and SortDescriptions collections, and sorting/grouping need to be carried out at the ViewModel level. The closest approach to a workable solution I've found is along the lines of Microsoft's sample package at</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/XamlListView"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/tree/master/Samples/XamlListView</a></p>

<p>and this article</p>

<p>where the ViewModel groups the ObservableCollection using Linq and presents it to the view as an ObservableCollection of grouped items</p>

<pre><code>public ObservableCollection&lt;GroupInfoList&gt; GroupedContacts
{
    ObservableCollection&lt;GroupInfoList&gt; groups = new ObservableCollection&lt;GroupInfoList&gt;();

    var query = from item in _cache.Contacts
                group item by item.LastName[0] into g
                orderby g.Key
                select new { GroupName = g.Key, Items = g };

    foreach (var g in query)
    {
         GroupInfoList info = new GroupInfoList();
         info.Key = g.GroupName;
         foreach (var item in g.Items)
         {
             info.Add(item);
         }
         groups.Add(info);
    }

    return groups;
}
</code></pre>

<p>where GroupInfoList is defined as </p>

<pre><code>public class GroupInfoList : List&lt;object&gt;
{
   public object Key { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This does at least get us a grouped collection displayed in the View, but updates to the datacache collection are no longer reflected in real time. We could capture the datacache's CollectionChanged event and use it in the viewmodel to refresh the GroupedContacts collection, but this creates a new collection for every change in the datacache, causing the ListView to flicker and reset selection etc which is clearly suboptimal.</p>

<p>Also swapping the grouping on the fly would seem to require a completely seperate ObservableCollection of grouped items for each grouping scenario, and for the ListView's ItemSource binding to be swapped at runtime.</p>

<p>The rest of what I've seen of the UWP environment seems extremely useful, so I'm surprised to find something as vital as grouping and sorting lists throwing up obstacles...</p>

<p>Anyone know how to do this properly?</p>

1607468,Why is 'this' undefined inside class method when using promises?,"<p>I have a javascript class, and each method returns a <code>Q</code> promise. I want to know why <code>this</code> is undefined in <code>method2</code> and <code>method3</code>. Is there a more correct way to write this code?</p>

<pre><code>function MyClass(opts){
  this.options = opts;

  return this.method1()
    .then(this.method2)
    .then(this.method3);
}

MyClass.prototype.method1 = function(){
  // ...q stuff...

  console.log(this.options); // logs ""opts"" object

  return deferred.promise;
};

MyClass.prototype.method2 = function(method1resolve){
  // ...q stuff...

  console.log(this); // logs undefined

  return deferred.promise;
};

MyClass.prototype.method3 = function(method2resolve){
  // ...q stuff...

  console.log(this); // logs undefined

1607469,Can cond support TF ops with side effects?,"<p>The (source code) documentation for <code>tf.cond</code> is unclear on whether the functions to be performed when the predicate is evaluated can have side effects or not. I've done some tests but I'm getting conflicting results. For example the code below does not work:</p>

<pre><code>import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.python.ops import control_flow_ops

pred = tf.placeholder(tf.bool, [])
count = tf.Variable(0)
adder = count.assign_add(1)
subtractor = count.assign_sub(2)

my_op = control_flow_ops.cond(pred, lambda: adder, lambda: subtractor)

sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
tf.initialize_all_variables().run()

my_op.eval(feed_dict={pred: True})
count.eval() # returns -1

my_op.eval(feed_dict={pred: False})
count.eval() # returns -2
</code></pre>

<p>I.e. no matter what value the predicate evaluates to, both functions are getting run, and so the net result is a subtraction of 1. On the other hand, this code snippet does work, where the only difference is that I add new ops to the graph every time <code>my_op</code> is called:</p>

<pre><code>pred = tf.placeholder(tf.bool, [])
count = tf.Variable(0)

my_op = control_flow_ops.cond(pred, lambda:count.assign_add(1), lambda:count.assign_sub(2))

sess = tf.InteractiveSession()
tf.initialize_all_variables().run()

my_op.eval(feed_dict={pred: False})
count.eval() # returns -2

my_op.eval(feed_dict={pred: True})
count.eval() # returns -1
</code></pre>

<p>Not sure why creating new ops every time works while the other case doesn't, but I'd obviously rather not be adding nodes as the graph will eventually become too big.</p>

We are currently setting up a server for intranet publishing which of course needs protection via an enterprise single sign on.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we are stuck with an IIS server as we need to run both PHP and .NET applications. The main app is programmed in PHP, but we have to feature some jQuery included widgets that rely on ASPX handlers.</p>

<p>The company offers all types of authentication. We've already successfully protected the server with Shibboleth (using SAML 2.0). It shows the ESO screen to login and then redirects to our server with a logged-in session. Unfortunately the widgets that are referring to the ASPX handlers don't authenticate correctly.</p>

<p>I've never done authentication / SAML / WiF / anything, so please excuse my question:</p>

<p>What would be the most promising way for authentication with our setup (IIS featuren PHP and ASPX apps)? Should we stick to SAML and Shibboleth or should we use WiF / WS Federation / Windows Authentication?</p>

<p>Is it possible to support both PHP and ASPX with one authentication method?</p>

1607473,Multi thread approach vs Akka actor model,"<p>I'm new to akka actor. I have read the akka offical documents and still don't understand how actor works compare to threading model.</p>

<p>Let's take a simple example like this. I have a traditional HttpServer , which have 10 threads in the thread pools . When 20 requests are coming at the same time , the HttpServer will delegate all 10 threads in the thread pool to handle the first 10 requests and the others will be queued in the network interface to wait for the thread to pick up.</p>

<p>How will an actor-based HttpServer react to the same problem?. Will all of the requests are queued in front of a delegated actors to process them in a sequential order and send the messages to other actor?. If so, this is the point that I don't understand how can actor provide better performance than threading model, because only 1 actor process 20 requests in a sequential order can not faster than 10 thread process 20 requests concurrently.</p>

<p>What I am trying to understand is that how actor react when multiple requests are coming together at the same time? , not how actor process and queue the message in the mail box , it's already showed up a lot in the documents. Can someone simulate the steps how actor work in this example?</p>

<pre><code>||| This type is parameterised by:

||| + The input resource.
||| + The computation to run on the resource given the return value.
Effect : Type
Effect = (x : Type) -&gt; Type -&gt; (x -&gt; Type) -&gt; Type
</code></pre>

<p>If we allow resources to be values and swap the first two arguments, we get (the rest of the code is in Agda)</p>

<pre><code>Effect : Set -&gt; Set
Effect R = R -&gt; (A : Set) -&gt; (A -&gt; R) -&gt; Set
</code></pre>

<p>Having some basic type-context-membership machinery</p>

<pre><code>data Type : Set where
  nat : Type
  _â‡’_ : Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type

data Con : Set where
  Îµ   : Con
  _â–»_ : Con -&gt; Type -&gt; Con

data _âˆˆ_ Ïƒ : Con -&gt; Set where
  vz  : âˆ€ {Î“}   -&gt; Ïƒ âˆˆ Î“ â–» Ïƒ
  vs_ : âˆ€ {Î“ Ï„} -&gt; Ïƒ âˆˆ Î“     -&gt; Ïƒ âˆˆ Î“ â–» Ï„
</code></pre>

<p>we can encode lambda terms constructors as follows:</p>

<pre><code>app-arg : Bool -&gt; Type -&gt; Type -&gt; Type
app-arg b Ïƒ Ï„ = if b then Ïƒ â‡’ Ï„ else Ïƒ

data TermE : Effect (Con Ã— Type) where
  Var   : âˆ€ {Î“ Ïƒ  } -&gt; Ïƒ âˆˆ Î“ -&gt; TermE (Î“ , Ïƒ     )  âŠ¥     Î»()
  Lam   : âˆ€ {Î“ Ïƒ Ï„} -&gt;          TermE (Î“ , Ïƒ â‡’ Ï„ )  âŠ¤    (Î» _ -&gt; Î“ â–» Ïƒ , Ï„            )
  App   : âˆ€ {Î“ Ïƒ Ï„} -&gt;          TermE (Î“ , Ï„     )  Bool (Î» b -&gt; Î“     , app-arg b Ïƒ Ï„)
</code></pre>

<p>In <code>TermE i r iâ€²</code> <code>i</code> is an output index (e.g. lambda abstractions (<code>Lam</code>) construct function types (<code>Ïƒ â‡’ Ï„</code>) (for ease of description I'll ignore that indices also contain contexts besides types)), <code>r</code> represents a number of inductive positions (<code>Var</code> doesn't (<code>âŠ¥</code>) receive any <code>TermE</code>, <code>Lam</code> receives one (<code>âŠ¤</code>), <code>App</code> receives two (<code>Bool</code>) â€” a function and its argument) and <code>iâ€²</code> computes an index at each inductive position (e.g. the index at the first inductive position of <code>App</code> is <code>Ïƒ â‡’ Ï„</code> and the index at the second is <code>Ïƒ</code>, i.e. we can apply a function to a value only if the type of the first argument of the function equals the type of the value).</p>

<p>To construct a real lambda term we must tie the knot using something like a <a href=""https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/blob/master/src/Data/W.agda"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>W</code></a> data type. Here is the definition:</p>

<pre><code>data Wer {R} (Î¨ : Effect R) : Effect R where
  call : âˆ€ {r A râ€² B râ€²â€²} -&gt; Î¨ r A râ€² -&gt; (âˆ€ x -&gt; Wer Î¨ (râ€² x) B râ€²â€²) -&gt; Wer Î¨ r B râ€²â€²
</code></pre>

<p>It's the indexed variant of the Oleg Kiselyov's <a href=""http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/extensible/more.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>Freer</code></a> monad (effects stuff again), but without <code>return</code>. Using this we can recover the usual constructors:</p>

<pre><code>_&lt;âˆ¨&gt;_ : âˆ€ {B : Bool -&gt; Set} -&gt; B true -&gt; B false -&gt; âˆ€ b -&gt; B b
(x &lt;âˆ¨&gt; y) true  = x
(x &lt;âˆ¨&gt; y) false = y

_âŠ¢_ : Con -&gt; Type -&gt; Set
Î“ âŠ¢ Ïƒ = Wer TermE (Î“ , Ïƒ) âŠ¥ Î»()

var : âˆ€ {Î“ Ïƒ} -&gt; Ïƒ âˆˆ Î“ -&gt; Î“ âŠ¢ Ïƒ
var v = call (Var v) Î»()

Æ›_ : âˆ€ {Î“ Ïƒ Ï„} -&gt; Î“ â–» Ïƒ âŠ¢ Ï„ -&gt; Î“ âŠ¢ Ïƒ â‡’ Ï„
Æ› b = call Lam (const b)

_Â·_ : âˆ€ {Î“ Ïƒ Ï„} -&gt; Î“ âŠ¢ Ïƒ â‡’ Ï„ -&gt; Î“ âŠ¢ Ïƒ -&gt; Î“ âŠ¢ Ï„
f Â· x = call App (f &lt;âˆ¨&gt; x)
</code></pre>

<p>The whole encoding is very similar to the <a href=""https://github.com/effectfully/DataData/blob/master/Container/Indexed.agda#L75"" rel=""noreferrer"">corresponding encoding</a> in terms of <a href=""http://strictlypositive.org/indexed-containers.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">indexed containers</a>: <code>Effect</code> corresponds to <code>IContainer</code> and <code>Wer</code> corresponds to <code>ITree</code> (the type of Petersson-Synek Trees). However the above encoding looks simpler to me, because you don't need to think about things you have to put into shapes to be able to recover indices at inductive positions. Instead, you have everything in one place and the encoding process is really straightforward.</p>

<p>So what am I doing here? Is there some real relation to the indexed containers approach (besides the fact that this encoding has the same <a href=""http://mazzo.li/epilogue/index.html%3Fp=324.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">extensionality problems</a>)? Can we do something useful this way? One natural thought is to built an effectful lambda calculus as we can freely mix lambda terms with effects, since a lambda term is itself just an effect, but it's an external effect and we either need other effects to be external as well (which means that we can't say something like <code>tell (var vz)</code>, because <code>var vz</code> is not a value â€” it's a computation) or we need to somehow internalize this effect and the whole effects machinery (which means I don't know what).</p>

<p>Say i have some divs i.e.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""box-1""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=""box-2""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=""box-3""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=""box-4""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>etc.</p>

<p>If these boxes need to be alternate colours. I need to create some css which basically does the following:</p>

<pre><code>.box-(odd-number) {
    color:#000;
}
.box-(even-number) {
    color:#fff;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously I know the above is not the correct syntax. Could some one point me in the right direction.</p>

1607487,How to set layer-wise learning rate in Tensorflow?,"<p>I am wondering if there is a way that I can use different learning rate for different layers like what is in Caffe. I am trying to modify a pre-trained model and use it for other tasks. What I want is to speed up the training for new added layers and keep the trained layers at low learning rate in order to prevent them from being distorted. for example, I have a 5-conv-layer pre-trained model. Now I add a new conv layer and fine tune it. The first 5 layers would have learning rate of 0.00001 and the last one would have 0.001. Any idea how to achieve this?</p>
